RTK works by receiving a correction signal from a nearby base station, that can
see the same satellites as your machine. As the base is at a fixed location,
it's able to correct for the difference induced by atmospheric delays as the
signal makes its way down from the satellite to your rover.

At a high level, you can think of it as being a hint for your machine: "the
satellites say I'm here, but that's approximate; the nearby base says I'm
actually offset 32.2cm over there instead so take that into account when you're
working out my position"
