## AIO v4.x issues and fixes

This section collects all the known (by the author) issues / fixes /
improvements one can do on a v4.x board.

**These fixed are for v4.1 STD / Standard only**

**v4.5 boards do NOT need these fixes!!**

The trace next to the ampseal is touching the direct 12V input, so for 24V
motors please cut the trace. For valves / 12V motor the outside 12V pin will
power your cytron directly. (so the label is misleading)

## AIO v2.x issues and fixes

This section collects all the known (by the author) issues / fixes /
improvements one can do on a v2.x board.

### Tougher traces

The Input diode can only handle 3A Cytron can do a lot more than the traces

Using it via 24V is okay or with relays it's okay as well.

12V 5-6A motor however requires users to add some extra wires.

### Pressure Sensor

The AiO's pressure input was meant for 20mA sensors, the above should modify it
for variable voltage input

Use the correct resistors as needed. For example, 5V input, use a 1:2 ratio (eg,
R1 3k, R2 6k or 5k to be safe) For 0-12V input, use a 3:1 ratio (eg, R1 6k, R2
2k)

### Free wheel mod fix

The reason for swapping the 330ohm to 1kohm is because linking PWM2 Cytron to
Teensy with 10ma is too much - they recommend 4ma max.
