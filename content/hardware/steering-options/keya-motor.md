## Overview

The Keya motor is a motorised steering wheel made and sold by Jinyan Keya. The
motor is one of the easiest ways to set up AgOpenGPS, and the result is a
relatively tidy system with great performance.

You can see what the Keya looks like in action in this

## Model selection

### Motor types

### Spline Adapters

Your machine will need an adapter to join the keya motor onto a splined steering
column. The table below can be used as a initial guide, but may be outdated. You
should **ALWAYS** measure the diameter and count the splines yourself. This is
for reference only.

## Configuration

You’ll need a modified Teensy firmware to work with the Keya Motor. A few users
have developed some 'in-testing' firmware which you can use in your own builds
at your own risk, such as
[Iansalot's Modified firmware for the teensy](https://github.com/lansalot/AgOpenGPS_Boards/blob/Keya/TeensyModules/V4.1/Firmware/AOG-Keya-CANBUS.hex).

The easiest route to get the right firmware installed on the Teensy is
[AOGConfigOMatic](https://github.com/lansalot/AOGConfigOMatic/releases). More
info on this process can be found on the
[Configuring the Teensy](/hardware/boards/configuring-boards/Configuring-The-Teensy)
page.

## Installation

You can use this
[discourse thread on keya installs](https://discourse.agopengps.com/t/keya-canbus-motor-great-success-many-happy-etc/14174)
as a guide for installation:

Download this [Keya template](../../files/KeyaTemplate.pdf), to help with
marking out for brackets or this template for the new 1.4 motor.

### Wiring

![image](../../img/keya-connector.png)

![image](../../img/keya-connector-pinout.png)

You’ll be powering 12V to pin 1, and GND to pin2 - and don’t power this through
the AOG board! Put it on its own supply with a big huge “OFF!” switch for
safety.

Pin 6 (CANH) goes to pin 16 on ampseal and pin 7 (CANL) goes to pin 17.

If you have the 4th gen motor that comes with the Deutsch connector, go by this
instead:

PLEASE NOTE: there are imitators on AliExpress selling Keya-lookalike motors.
The link above is to their official shop. Please support Keya as they are known
to work well, and we have great support from the manufacturer. Other motors are
not always known to work correctly, and Keya cannot support them if you come to
the channel asking for help.

If you're in Europe you might want to check
[navisklep.pl](https://navisklep.pl/p/silnik-kierownica-keya/) They'll supply
with the 3 spoked wheel.
