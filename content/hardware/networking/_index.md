Based on the PGNs one can create modules for the Steering, GPS, Machine, IMU,
etc.

There's a detailed guide on ethernet configuration

Just download and save in your Wireshark plugins folder (not any subfolders, eg
4.0). Please report any issues either on that AgOpenGPS-Tools repo, or to
andyinv on the forums or Telegram.
