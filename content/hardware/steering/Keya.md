To order, the official link for the latest version of the steering wheel -
direct from Keya themselves - is
[here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008796635857.html). PLEASE NOTE:
there are imitators on AliExpress selling Keya-lookalike motors. The link here
is to their official shop. Please support Keya as they are known to work well,
and we have great support from the manufacturer. Other motors are not always
known to work correctly, and Keya cannot support them if you come to the channel
asking for help.

Keya reference manual:
[Keya KY170DD01005-08G v2.4.pdf](https://github.com/AgOpenGPS-Official/Boards/files/15389407/Keya.KY170DD01005-08G.v2.4.pdf)

If you're in Europe you might want to check
[navisklep.pl](https://navisklep.pl/p/silnik-kierownica-keya/) They'll supply
with the 3 spoked wheel.

You need to specify when ordering which steering boss you require (and let them
know if you require additional ones). Pay attention to the aliexpress link, the
"View more" bit will list all the adapter types. NOTE: this list below might be
out of date as more models are added, so look for this chart on the aliexpress
link!!

Connections:

You’ll be powering 12V to pin 1, and GND to pin2 - and don’t power this through
the AOG board! Put it on its own supply with a big huge “OFF!” switch for
safety.

Pin 6 (CANH) goes to pin 16 on ampseal and pin 7 (CANL) goes to pin 17.

If you have the 4th gen motor that comes with the Deutsch connector, go by this
instead:

You’ll need a modified firmware and while the hope is that this eventually goes
to mainstream, at the moment it’s still considered as in-testing, so I haven’t
submitted a PR to the main branch as yet.

You can find my modified firmware
[here](https://github.com/lansalot/AgOpenGPS_Boards/blob/Keya/TeensyModules/V4.1/Firmware/AOG-Keya-CANBUS.hex)
but make life easier by using
