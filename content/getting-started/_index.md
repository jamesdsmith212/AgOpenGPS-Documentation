# Quick-Start Guide (~10 minutes) 🚀

Welcome! This page gives you the **bare-minimum knowledge** to understand
AgOpenGPS. Before making big purchase decisions, dive into the in-depth sections
linked throughout.

## What is AgOpenGPS?

**AgOpenGPS (AOG)** is an open-source autosteer and implement-control system.  
The software runs on a Windows tablet and, together with community-built
hardware (PCBs, sensors, motor drivers), guides farm machinery with
**centimetre-level accuracy**.

---

## Why do farmers want autosteer?

- Reduce driver fatigue
- Save inputs through precise spraying, fertilising, and seeding
- Work accurately in dust, fog, or after dark

---

## Why choose AgOpenGPS over commercial kits?

- **Cost:** ~1/5th of the cost of typical commercial systems with similar
  functionality
- **Open source:** free code, schematics, and PCB files—improve or customise at
  will
- **Adaptable:** fits almost any tractor with a bit of tinkering and community
  support

## Levels of AgOpenGPS 🛠️

| Level                           | What it does                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Light-bar guidance**          | Generates guidance lines—driver steers manually                        |
| **Full autosteer**              | Tablet sends commands; motor or valve steers automatically             |
| **Autosteer + Section Control** | Autosteer plus automatic boom/section on-off to avoid overlap          |
| **Autosteer + Rate Control**    | Autosteer plus variable-rate output based on speed or prescription map |

## Which level should I start with?

Most users jump straight to **full autosteer**; you can add Section or Rate
Control later.  
If you only need a light-bar, start simple—but know you can upgrade without
replacing core components.

## Basic overview of the system

Before you dive into part lists, here's what each main component does.

### Components needed for **light-bar guidance**

- **Location signal** – Every AgOpenGPS setup needs a GNSS fix (often called
  GPS).  
  A [**ZED-F9P receiver plus roof-mounted antenna**](/hardware/Other-components/gnss-modules)
  streams position to the tablet so the software always knows where the tractor
  is—typically within a few centimetres.
- [**Windows tablet or laptop**](/hardware/Other-components/tablet) – Rugged,
  sunlight-readable Windows 10/11 device (4 GB RAM min). Runs AgOpenGPS and lets
  you switch guidance on/off.
- [**AgOpenGPS software**](/software) – The "brain" of the system: reads GNSS
  data, shows a live map/light-bar, logs coverage, and decides the next steering
  move.

### Extra parts for **full autosteer**

- [**Wheel-angle sensor (WAS)**](/hardware/Other-components/wheel-angle-sensor)
  – Reports the actual steering angle so AgOpenGPS can correct in real time.
- [**Steering actuator**](/hardware/steering-options/) – Converts software
  commands into wheel movement. Options include a DC steering motor, retrofit
  motorised wheel, proportional hydraulic valve, or factory CAN valve.
- **Roll / heading compensation (optional)**
  - _Single-antenna builds:_ add an
    [**IMU**](/hardware/Other-components/imu-inertial-measurement-unit) (e.g.
    BNO085).
  - _Dual-antenna builds:_ two
    [GNSS receivers](/hardware/Other-components/gnss-modules) provide heading
    and roll, so no IMU is needed.
- **Control PCB** – Acts as a central point that routes power and signals,
  connects sensors, and drives the motor or valve. First-time users would
  typically go for the latest
  ['all-in-one' board - currently v4.5](/hardware/boards/all-in-one-boards)
- **RTK correction signal** _(optional but recommended)_ – AgOpenGPS's built-in
  NTRIP client can fetch RTCM data from public, commercial, or DIY base stations
  to reach 1–2 cm accuracy.

With these elements installed, you can upgrade from simple light-bar guidance to
fully automated, centimetre-accurate steering.
